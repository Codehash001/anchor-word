## Anchor Word

Anchor Word is a fast, bite-sized word puzzle you can play directly on Reddit.

Each challenge post contains 4–6 clue words. All clues share the same hidden anchor substring which appears either at the start or the end of every clue. Your goal is to guess the anchor.

## How It Works

- **Clues**: The UI shows 4–6 words with the anchor removed (e.g., `sheet`, `room`, `sea`, `flower`). The true words all share a hidden anchor at the start or end (e.g., `bed` → `bed-sheet`, `bed-room`, `bed-sea`, `bed-flower` are illustrative).
- **Anchor**: A short, valid English word which is prepended or appended to every clue word.
- **Attempts**: You submit guesses until you find the anchor. Attempts are tracked per user per post.
- **Scoring (Anchor Points)**: Points awarded on a correct answer depend on how many attempts you took (see “Anchor Points” below).
- **Results**: After solving, you can view the full solution breakdown and leaderboard for that challenge.

# How to Play Anchor Word

## 🎯 Objective
Find the anchor substring that appears in all the given words. The anchor can be at the beginning or end of each word, and both the anchor and the remaining parts must be valid English words.

## 📝 How to Play
1. Look at the 4–6 clue words provided
2. Find the common substring that appears in all words (at the start or the end)
3. Type your guess in the input field
4. Click "Guess" or press Enter to submit
5. You have unlimited attempts to solve each puzzle

## ✅ Valid Example
- Words: bedroom, bedsheet, bedrock, seabed, flowerbed
- Answer: "bed"
- Why it works:
  - bed + room = bedroom (both valid words)
  - bed + sheet = bedsheet (both valid words)
  - sea + bed = seabed (both valid words)

## ❌ Invalid Example
- bedazzle – "azzle" is not a valid English word
- bedphone – "phone" is valid, but "bed" + "phone" does not satisfy the rule that each clue must start or end cleanly with the same anchor and the other part must still be a valid English word in context

## 🏆 Scoring System (Anchor Points)
Anchor Points are awarded only for correct answers:
- 1st attempt: +20 points
- 2nd attempt: +15 points
- 3rd attempt: +10 points
- 4th+ attempts: +5 points
- No correct answer: 0 points
